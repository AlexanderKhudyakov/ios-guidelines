# Contributing to the Badoo Swift Style Guide.

Contributing to this style guide is very straightforward

### Step 1: Be iOS developer in Badoo

https://badoo.com/team/jobs/137/

### Step 2: Open an Issue

Open an issue on github and describe the change you would like to see or rule that you would like to have added. You can even propose the exact change in github markdown which can be pasted into the guide.

If proposed change is small enough you can create pull request straight away. In that case proposal would be discussed inside PR

### Step 3: Wait for iOS team feedback

Wait for feedback on the issue. Style guides are very subjective and other developers may not agree with you.

### Step 4: Vote for issue

You should use "like" or "dislike" for first message in an issue. Issue should be approved by 2/3 of team members.

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request

Create a pull request with all required changes.

### Step 6: Branch Merged

Congratulations! You did a good job!
